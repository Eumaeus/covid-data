I used my own, fallible, subjective judgement about which category to use, when (1) and (2) disagreed. So, Massachusetts was very, very blue in 2016, and I left it that way despite the state's having a Republican governor. On the other hand, Michigan was a red-state in 2016, but its Democratic governor seems to be playing a very dominant role in that state's response to the crisis, so Michigan is \"blue\" in this chart.\n",
