    "When I read a headline like [\"Neil Ferguson's Imperial model could be the most devastating software mistake of all time\"](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/05/16/neil-fergusons-imperial-model-could-devastating-software-mistake/), my inner dillettante immediately says, \"I'd like to try that!\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Why not try? Imperial College and Neil Fergusun is regularly off by one-to-three orders of magnitude in his predictions so if I can beat that, I, too, can be the toast of London and excempt from quarantine rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "The top part of this notebook consists of configurations. The more interesting stuff is below. I am not a professional any of the domains that this notebook touches on, so I make no claims.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a lot of code before we get down to being able to run the simulation. Most of it consists of tests for each Class and each Function. These tests include `assert` statements, checking for correct and reproducible, deterministic, function throughout, given the same starting seed for pseudo-random number generation. The simulation will not run if it has not proven to be reproducible. If in no other way, that makes my model [superior to the Imperial College \"model\"](https://lockdownsceptics.org/code-review-of-fergusons-model/)."

    "- [Model-2](model-2.ipynb): A second test-run. Two identical populations, all other parameters identical *except* one has an `infectivity` of 2.5% and the other has one of 2.6%.\n",
